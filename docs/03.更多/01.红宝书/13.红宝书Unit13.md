## 文章

<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';font-size: 1.1em;">At the outset of his employment, he was a competent and agreeable employee who always complied with his employer's requests. He had a specific aim to become a specialist in his field and he endeavored to complete his tasks in a brisk and brief manner. He would browse the latest research and compile reports that were complex but not complicated. He would also compliment his colleagues and complement their work with his own skills.</br></br>
However, as time went by, he became more aggressive and competitive. He started to compare himself with others and felt a difference in their performance. He wanted to compensate for his perceived shortcomings and he began to compete with his peers in a unhealthy way. He would complain about their work and make complaints to his boss. He would also agitate and aggravate them with his rude remarks and actions.</br></br>
This alienated him from his team and altered the atmosphere in the office. He encountered more problems and challenges that he could not handle alone. He refused to accept any aid or advice from others and he did not endorse their opinions or suggestions. He also did not appreciate any compliments or encouragement that they gave him.</br></br>
He became more isolated and unhappy. He felt that his work was no longer an alternative but an obligation. He did not enjoy it anymore and he lost his passion and motivation. He also felt that his employer did not value him or his work and he did not trust him anymore.</br></br>
One day, he decided to quit his job and look for another one. He hoped to find a better opportunity that would enable him to achieve his goals and satisfy his needs. He did not realize that he had made a mistake that would have serious consequences for his future.</br></br>
He did not know that his former employer had given him a negative reference that indicated his poor performance and attitude. This made it difficult for him to find another job in the same field. He also did not know that his former colleagues had spread the word about his behavior and reputation. This made it hard for him to make new connections and contacts.</br></br>
He soon found himself in a situation where he had no job, no income, no friends, and no prospects. He felt an outrage at his fate and blamed everyone but himself for his misfortune. He did not learn from his experience or try to improve himself. He only speculated about what could have been if things had been different.</br></br>
He did not realize that he had wasted a precious opportunity that many people would have loved to have. He did not appreciate the value of teamwork, cooperation, respect, and gratitude. He did not understand that success is not only a matter of comparison or competition, but also of competence and character.

## 翻译

<p style="font-family: '仿宋'; font-size: 1.em;">在他就业的开始，他是一个能干和随和的员工，总是遵从雇主的要求。他有一个明确的目标，就是要成为他领域的专家，他努力以迅速和简洁的方式完成他的任务。他会浏览最新的研究并编写报告，这些报告虽然复杂但并不复杂。他还会赞美他的同事并用自己的技能补充他们的工作。</br></br>
然而，随着时间的推移，他变得更加好斗和有竞争心。他开始与别人比较，并感觉到他们的表现有差异。他想要弥补自己认为的不足，并开始以一种不健康的方式与同行竞争。他会抱怨他们的工作并向老板投诉。他还会用无礼的言行激怒和恶化他们。</br></br>
这使他与团队疏远并改变了办公室的氛围。他遇到了更多的问题和挑战，他无法独自应对。他拒绝接受任何来自别人的帮助或建议，也不认可他们的意见或建议。他也不欣赏他们给予他的赞美或鼓励。</br></br>
他变得更加孤立和不快乐。他觉得他的工作不再是一种选择而是一种义务。他不再享受它，也失去了激情和动力。他也觉得雇主不重视他或他的工作，也不再信任他。</br></br>
有一天，他决定辞掉工作并寻找另一份工作。他希望找到一个更好的机会，能够让他实现自己的目标并满足自己的需求。他没有意识到自己犯了一个严重的错误，会对自己的未来造成严重后果。</br></br>
他不知道，他以前的雇主给了他一个负面的参考，表明了他糟糕的表现和态度。这使得他很难在同一领域找到另一份工作。他也不知道，以前的同事们已经传播了关于他行为和声誉的消息。这使得他很难建立新的联系和联系。</br></br>
很快，他发现自己处于一种没有工作、没有收入、没有朋友、没有前途的境地。他对自己的命运感到愤怒，并责怪所有人但不是自己造成了自己的不幸。他没有从经验中学习或尝试改进自己。只是猜测如果事情有所不同会怎样。</br></br>
他没有意识到，自己浪费了一个宝贵的机会，许多人都想拥有。他没有意识到团队合作、合作、尊重和感激的价值。也没有理解成功不仅是比较或竞争的问题，也是能力和品格的问题。
